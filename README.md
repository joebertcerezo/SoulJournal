# SoulJournal - Your Personal AI-powered daily journal

SoulJournal is a modern, secure, and performant web application designed to be your private space for thoughts and emotions. It's a digital journal that not only allows you to record your daily entries but also connects you with an AI "soul" to explore your feelings and gain new perspectives.

## About The Project

This project is a full-stack journaling application built with a focus on user experience, performance, and security. Users can sign up, log in, and manage their journal entries. Each entry can be tagged with specific emotions, providing a way to track emotional states over time. The standout feature is the "Chat with Soul," an AI-powered chat that allows users to interact with their thoughts in a novel way.
